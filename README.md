# box

Box is a 2D puzzle game heavily insipired by The Talos Principle (awesome first person puzzle game) and to some extent by Portal. Play it at: https://cristiandima.github.io/box/

Your goal as a player in this game is to get to the box. To do that you'll have to avoid mines, move squares around, open doors, connect light beams, and teleport to otherwise inaccessible locations. Click the "i" icon in the game menu for more details on game mechanics and controls.

There's also a level editor bundled with the game. Hit the pencil icon to get to it. Again, more info about how this works is available via the "i" icon. You can use this editor to create a level and then save it as json. To make the level available in game you'll have to copy the json to the levels.ts file and rebuild the ts project. Feel free to submit your own levels to this repository via a pull request.

The game is written in typescript and compiled to es5.
